        Opening credits play against generic footage of Johnny stalking about San Francisco
        
        Exterior shot of Johnny’s car pulling up outside his house
        
        Johnny enters the living room
        
        Johnny: Hi babe! I have something for you.
        
        Lisa: What is it?
        
        Johnny: Just a little something.
        
        He playfully hides the package, then presents it to Lisa. She opens it to find a red dress.
        
        Lisa: Johnny, it’s beautiful. Thank you. Can I try it on now?
        
        Johnny: Sure, it’s yours.
        
        Lisa: Wait right here. (she grabs Johnny’s tie and kisses him) I’ll try it on right now.
        
        Johnny sits down. Cut to Lisa reemerging from the stairs in the red dress.
        
        Johnny: Wow, you look so sexy, Lisa.
        
        Lisa: Isn’t it fabulous?
        
        Johnny: I would do anything for my girl.
        
        Enter Denny
        
        Denny: Oh hey, guys.
        
        Johnny: Oh hi, Denny.
        
        Denny: Wow! Look at you!
        
        Lisa: It’s from Johnny.
        
        Johnny: Anything for my princess! Ha-ha-ha-ha.
        
        Denny: How much was it?
        
        Lisa: Denny, don’t ask a question like that!
        
        Johnny: Nice to see you, Denny. I’m going to take a nap.
        
        Denny: Can I go upstairs too?
        
        Johnny: Ha-ha!
        
        Lisa: Denny, I think I’m gonna join him.
        
        Johnny: A-ha-ha.
        
        They exit upstairs, speaking barely audibly
        
        Lisa: I’ve got some candles upstairs.
        
        Johnny: You always think. A-ha-ha. Alright, I’m ready.
        
        Lisa: This is so pretty, I can’t wait for you to get it off of me.
        
        Johnny: Oh, yeahhh.
        
        Denny takes a bite of an apple, then follows them upstairs.
        
        In the bedroom, Johnny and Lisa start a pillow fight.
        
        Johnny: A-ha-ha! (incomprehensible gibberish) Ha-ha-ha! Ouch!
        
        Denny joins in and gets clobbered as everyone laughs.
        
        <a href="">Denny: No, stop!
        
        Johnny: Denny, do you have something else to do?</a>
        
        Denny: I just like to watch you guys.
        
        Lisa: Oh, Denny, Denny, Denny boy!
        
        Johnny: Denny, two’s great, but three’s a crowd, ha-ha.
        
        Denny: I get it. You guys want to <a href="">be alone.
        
        Johnny: That’s the idea!
        
        Denny: Fine. I have homework to do</a> anyway. Bye, lovebirds!
        
        Johnny: Bye, Denny.
        
        Lisa: Bye, Denny.
        
        Denny exits, and a three-minute love scene commences, scored to terrible R&B. There’s a lot <a href="">of water and rose petals and naked boobs. Johnny fucks Lisa’s belly button</a>. Afterwards they lie awkwardly in bed together, and Lisa seems bored with Johnny as he sleeps.
        
        The alarm clock goes off at :28. Johnny gets up, smells a rose, and <a href="">bares his ass to the camera. He emerges from the bathroom dressed for work</a> and greets Lisa.
        
        Johnny: Did you like last night?
        
        Lisa: Yes I did.
        
        Johnny: Ha-ha-ha.
        
        Lisa: Can I get you anything?
        
        Johnny: Unh-unh. I have to go now.
        
        Lisa: Okay, bye.
        
        Johnny: Bye.
        
        Johnny exits. Cut to an exterior daytime shot of the house, then to the living room. Lisa answers the door, and Claudette enters.
        
        Lisa: Hi mom, how are you?
        
        Claudette: I’m fine, how are you? Hmmm? Okay, let’s go to the couch, and we will sit down. Now, what’s happening with you? Hmmm?
        
        Lisa: Nothing much. Do you want some coffee?
        
        Claudette: What’s wrong? Tell me.
        
        Lisa: I’m not feeling good today.
        
        Claudette: Well, why not?
        
        Lisa: I don’t love him anymore.
        
        Claudette: Why don’t you love him anymore? Tell me.
        
        Lisa: He’s so boring.
        
        Claudette: You’ve known him for over five years. You’re engaged. You said you loved him. He supports you, he provides for you, and darling, you can’t support yourself. He’s a wonderful man, and he loves you very much. And his position is very secure. And he told me he plans to buy you a house.
        
        Lisa: That’s why he’s so boring!
        
        Claudette: Well, what are you going to do?
        
        Lisa: I don’t know. I don’t mind living with him.
        
        Claudette: Well, you can’t do that. Have you talked to him about it?
        
        Lisa: No. I don’t know what to do.
        
        Claudette: Well, he’s a wonderful person. And he’s getting a promotion very soon. Now he bought you a car, he bought you a ring, clothes, whatever you wanted, and now you want to dump him. That’s not right. I’ve always thought of him as my son-in-law. You should marry Johnny, he would be good for you.</p>
